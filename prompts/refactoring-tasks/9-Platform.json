  "title": "Refactor Platform Module (Platform-specific support functions)",
  "description": "Gather all operating system specific helpers into a Platform module. This will include things like console configuration, terminal detection, and any filesystem nuances that differ between OSes:contentReference[oaicite:111]{index=111}. By centralizing these, the core logic can remain clean and cross-platform, calling Platform functions when needed for OS-specific behavior.",
  "goals": [
    "Implement a function to detect if the output is a TTY (terminal) or not, for use in auto-color decision (using e.g., isatty on POSIX, GetFileInformation on Windows).",
    "Implement enabling of ANSI color support on Windows (setting console mode to enable virtual terminal sequences) so that color codes are interpreted correctly:contentReference[oaicite:112]{index=112}.",
    "Provide other needed OS abstractions: e.g., a function to get terminal width (for `--color=auto` and default width calculations), and possibly wrappers for high-resolution timers if needed for Perf (Windows vs Linux API differences).",
    "Isolate any direct Win32 or POSIX calls (like SetConsoleMode, ioctl, getpwuid, etc.) behind this module’s interface or keep them contained in their respective specialized modules (FileOwnershipResolver already handles getpwuid/LookupAccountName, so leave that there). The goal is to minimize scattered `#ifdef _WIN32` in the code."
  ],
  "scope": [
    "Introduce `Platform::enableVirtualTerminal()` that performs the Windows console API calls (SetConsoleMode) to enable ANSI escape processing:contentReference[oaicite:113]{index=113}. On non-Windows, this can be a no-op or always return true.",
    "Introduce `Platform::isOutputTerminal()` (or similar) to check if std::cout is a terminal. Use `isatty(fileno(stdout))` on POSIX and `GetConsoleMode` or `GetFileType` on Windows to determine this. This will be used for `--color=auto` logic.",
    "If needed, introduce `Platform::getTerminalWidth()` to get the current terminal column count. This could use ioctl(TIOCGWINSZ) on POSIX or GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo on Windows. If such detail is considered out-of-scope, we can rely on CLI11's `CLI::App::get_terminal_size` or skip, but current code’s effective_terminal_width suggests they attempt it:contentReference[oaicite:114]{index=114}.",
    "Keep platform-specific includes and definitions within this module. For example, include <windows.h> only in Platform.cpp (or a dedicated source) and not globally. Define any necessary constants like NOMINMAX or UNICODE in that implementation file."
  ],
  "exclusions": [
    "Do not replicate functionality already handled in other modules: e.g., user/group name resolution is done in FileOwnershipResolver with OS-specific code, so Platform need not duplicate that.",
    "Networking or other OS aspects outside our tool's scope are irrelevant here; focus only on console and filesystem/terminal differences that affect this utility.",
    "Do not introduce new dependencies; use the C++17/20 standard library and OS APIs directly as needed. (No need for something like Boost for these basic tasks.)",
    "Avoid changing behaviors that are not already present: e.g., if currently the tool doesn’t adjust output to terminal width except for `-x`/`-C` column fitting, we don’t add new fancy resizing logic beyond what is needed to maintain current features."
  ],
  "architectural_recommendations": [
    "Use conditional compilation inside Platform module (e.g., `#ifdef _WIN32`) to implement OS-specific parts, while exposing a unified interface. For instance, Platform::isOutputTerminal can be implemented differently per OS but called uniformly.",
    "Keep the interface minimal and focused – we might only need a handful of functions now. However, structure it so that adding new platform checks later is straightforward (perhaps group console-related functions together).",
    "Return simple types (bool, int) from these functions and let the caller decide how to use them. For example, Platform::getTerminalWidth could return an `int` (or std::optional<int> if it can fail), and Renderer or Config can use that to decide layout or default width.",
    "Ensure that calling these functions when not applicable is safe (e.g., calling enableVirtualTerminal on Linux does nothing but returns true, etc.). This way, higher-level code can call them without wrapping each call in OS checks."
  ],
  "cli_considerations": [
    "`--color=auto`: The Platform.isOutputTerminal() is essential to implement the \"auto\" behavior. During Config initialization, if color mode is Auto, use this to set Config.no_color = true if output is not a terminal (redirected). That ensures no color codes in pipes/files, matching GNU ls default logic.",
    "Terminal width usage: The `--width=0` convention means \"auto-detect width\". Platform.getTerminalWidth() should provide this. If detection fails, a conservative default (80 or 100 columns) can be used. This affects how many columns -C mode will produce or how `--comma` output wraps.",
    "Ensure that enabling virtual terminal on Windows is done early (before any color output). App should call Platform::enableVirtualTerminal() at startup (already done in main):contentReference[oaicite:115]{index=115}. This call should not produce errors to the user; if it fails (old Windows not supporting it), Config or Theme might want to fall back to no_color automatically.",
    "Locale considerations: If `--time-style=locale` is used, the formatting might rely on the C locale. Platform might not need to do much here except ensure `std::locale()` or the default C locale is set/available. We might note that on Windows, classic locale might differ from POSIX for date format. For now, assume the standard C++ locale facets handle it consistently."
